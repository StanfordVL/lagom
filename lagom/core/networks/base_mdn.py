class BaseMDN(BaseNetwork):
    r"""Base class for Mixture Density Networks (we use Gaussian mixture). 
    
    This class defines the mixture density networks using isotropic Gaussian densities. 
    
    The network receives input tensor and outputs parameters for a mixture of Gaussian distributions. 
    i.e. mixing coefficients, means and variances. 
    
    Specifically, their dimensions are following, given N is batch size, K is the number of densities
    and D is the data dimension
    
    - mixing coefficients: ``[N, K, D]``
    - mean: ``[N, K, D]``
    - variance: ``[N, K, D]``
    
    The subclass should implement at least the following:

    - :meth:`make_feature_layers`
    - :meth:`make_mdn_heads`
    - :meth:`init_params`
    - :meth:`feature_forward`
