class RankTransform(BaseTransform):
    r"""Rank transformation of the input vector. The rank has the same dimensionality as input vector.
    Each element in the rank indicates the index of the ascendingly sorted input.
    i.e. ranks[i] = k, it means i-th element in the input is k-th smallest value. 
    
    Rank transformation reduce sensitivity to outliers, e.g. in OpenAI ES, gradient computation
    involves fitness values in the population, if there are outliers (too large fitness), it affects
    the gradient too much. 
    
    Note that a centered rank transformation to the range [-0.5, 0.5] is supported by an option.
