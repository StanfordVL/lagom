    .. warning::
    
        We do not subtract running mean from reward but only divides it by running
        standard deviation. Because subtraction by mean will alter the reward shape
        so this might degrade the performance. 
        
    .. note::
    
        Each :meth:`reset`, we do not clean up the ``self.all_returns`` buffer. Because
        of discount factor (:math:`< 1`), the running averages will converge after some iterations. 
        Therefore, we do not allow discounted factor as :math:`1.0` since it will lead to
        unbounded explosion of reward running averages. 
        
    Args:
        venv (VecEnv): a vectorized environment
        clip (float): clipping range of standardized reward, i.e. [-clip, clip]
        gamma (float): discounted factor. Note that the value 1.0 should not be used. 
        constant_std (ndarray): Constant standard deviation to standardize reward. Note that
            when it is provided, then running average will be ignored.
