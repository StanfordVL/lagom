    It creates a number of workers each with an individual Process. The communication between master
    and each worker is via independent Pipe connection. The master assigns tasks to workers. When all
    tasks are done, it stops all workers and terminate all processes.

        If there are more tasks than workers, then tasks will be splitted into chunks.
