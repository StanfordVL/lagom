        It automatically creates all subfolders for logging the experiment. The topmost
        folder is indicated by the logging directory specified in the configuration. 
        Then all subfolders for each configuration are created with the name of their ID.
        Finally, under each configuration subfolder, a set subfolders are created for each
        random seed (the random seed as folder name). Intuitively, an experiment could have
