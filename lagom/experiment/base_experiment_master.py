    r"""Base class for the master of parallelized experiment. 
    
    It firstly makes a list of all possible configurations (from :meth:`make_configs`), each associated
    with a list of random seeds (from :meth:`make_seeds`). Then it distribute the configurations to 
    workers (:class:`BaseExperimentWorker`) to execute the algorithm with specific configuration. 
    
    The total number of jobs is the number of configurations times the number of random seeds.
    
    .. note::
        If the number of configurations is larger than the number of workers, then the jobs are splitted
        into iterations, each iteration has the maximum capacity as the number of workers. 
        
    See :class:`BaseIterativeMaster` for more details about the iterative master.
    
    The subclass should implement at least the following:

    - :meth:`make_configs`
    - :meth:`make_seeds`
    - :meth:`process_algo_result`

            max_num_worker (int, optional): maximum number of workers. It has following use cases:
            
                * If ``None``, then number of wokers set to be the total number of configurations
                  times the number of random seeds. 
                * If number of configurations less than this max bound, then the number of workers
                  reduces to the number of configurations.
                * If number of configurations larger than this max bound, then the number of workers
                  equals to this max bound. The rest of configurations are splitted into batches, 
                  and run them iteratively with this max bound.
                  
            daemonic_worker (bool): If ``True``, then set all workers to be daemonic. The reason to 
                use daemonic process is because if main process crashes, we should not cause things to hang.
