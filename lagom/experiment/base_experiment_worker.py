class BaseExperimentWorker(BaseWorker):
    r"""Base class for the worker of parallelized experiment. 
    
    It executes the algorithm with the configuration and random seed which are distributed by the master. 
    
    .. note::
    
        If the configuration indicates to use GPU (i.e. ``config['cuda']=True``), then each worker will
        assign a specific CUDA device for PyTorch in rolling manner. Concretely, if there are 5 GPUs
        available and the master assigns 30 workers in current iteration, then each GPU will be assigned
        by 6 workers. The GPU is chosen by the worker ID modulus total number of GPUs. In other words, the 
        workers iterate over all GPUs in rolling manner trying to use all GPUs exhaustively for maximal speedup. 
    
    See :class:`BaseWorker` for more details about the workers.
    
    The subclass should implement at least the following:
