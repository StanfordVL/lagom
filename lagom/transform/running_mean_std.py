    r"""Estimates sample mean and standard deviation by using `Chan's method`_. 
    
    .. note::
    
        It supports for both scalar and high-dimensional data. If input data is a scalar
        value or a single vector of values, then it would be treated as a batch with the
        batch size :math:`1`. Otherwise, the first dimension will always be treated as
        batch dimension. Note that there is an ambiguity of a single vector of values, it
        can be either a batch of scalars or a single high-dimensional data, here it is treated
        as a batch of scalars, so for the latter case, the user has to add a batch dimension
        before feeding such data. 
    
    .. warning::
    
        The internal batched mean and variance are calculated over the first dimension. This allows
        to deal with batched data with shape ``[N, ...]`` where ``N`` is the batch size.
    
    Example:
    
        >>> runningavg = RunningMeanStd()
        >>> [runningavg(i) for i in [1, 2, 3, 4]]
        >>> runningavg.mu
        array(2.5, dtype=float32)
        
        >>> runningavg.sigma
        array(1.118034, dtype=float32)
        
        >>> runningavg = RunningMeanStd()
        >>> runningavg([[1, 4], [2, 3], [3, 2], [4, 1]])
        >>> runningavg.mu
        array([2.5, 2.5], dtype=float32)
        
        >>> runningavg.sigma
        array([1.118034, 1.118034], dtype=float32)
