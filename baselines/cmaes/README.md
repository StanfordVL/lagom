# Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES)

This is an implementation of [CMA-ES](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00772) algorithm. 

# Usage

Run the following command to start parallelized training:

```bash
python experiment.py
```

One could modify [experiment.py](./experiment.py) to quickly set up different configurations.
